              The classical concept of the four temperaments—the four personality
              types characterized as the fiery choleric, the airy sanguine, the
              watery phlegmatic and the earthy melancholic—has been revered by
              <br />
              many significant thinkers over the ages. In a refreshing treatment,
              Dr. Childs demonstrates that this ancient doctrine remains relevant
              <br />
              to our modern lives. He shows how we can recognize the temperaments
              in others, as well as in ourselves, and how to understand the ways
              <br />
              in which they function. Understanding their influences can boost
              personal development and help improve interpersonal relationships.

                Great book yet somewhat advanced. Without 20+ years of studying the
                4 temperaments, I would have struggled with Childs' book were I a
                beginner. <br />
                If you're new to studying the 4 temperaments, check out "Personality
                Plus" by Florence Littauer and her many other wonderful books. Also
                books by Tim LaHaye on the temperaments, although his emphasis on
                Christianity can be a <br />
                little heavy going at times. However, LaHaye's material is well
                worth the read, especially on temperament blends. <br />
                Also look into "The Four Temperaments" by Randy Rolfe, J.D., M.A.
