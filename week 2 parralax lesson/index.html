            The classical concept of the four temperaments—the four personality
            types characterized as the fiery choleric, the airy sanguine, the
            watery phlegmatic and the earthy melancholic—has been revered by
            <br />
            many significant thinkers over the ages. In a refreshing treatment,
            Dr. Childs demonstrates that this ancient doctrine remains relevant
            <br />
            to our modern lives. He shows how we can recognize the temperaments
            in others, as well as in ourselves, and how to understand the ways
            <br />
            in which they function. Understanding their influences can boost
            personal development and help improve interpersonal relationships.

            Conversational in tone and easily digestible, this book features
            fascinating discussions of the relationships between adults of
            various temperaments. <br />
            Childs reviews matters of compatibility in partnership, family and
            workplace situations, liberally spicing his commentary with amusing
            examples of likely scenarios. <br />
            He investigates the origins and manifestations of the temperaments
            in both their psychological and physiological aspects <br />
            included is a section on the temperaments of children, along with
            helpful and practical advice on dealing with individual issues

            Great book yet somewhat advanced. Without 20+ years of studying the
            4 temperaments, I would have struggled with Childs' book were I a
            beginner. <br />
            If you're new to studying the 4 temperaments, check out "Personality
            Plus" by Florence Littauer and her many other wonderful books. Also
            books by Tim LaHaye on the temperaments, although his emphasis on
            Christianity can be a <br />
            little heavy going at times. However, LaHaye's material is well
            worth the read, especially on temperament blends. <br />
            Also look into "The Four Temperaments" by Randy Rolfe, J.D., M.A.
